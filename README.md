# clima_app

Clima is a simple Flutter-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and a fun message based on the weather. Users can get weather by their current location or by searching for a city.

This project is built with Flutter and demonstrates key concepts like state management, API integration, geolocation, and navigation between screens.

Features
Current Location Weather: Automatically fetches weather data based on the device's GPS location.

City Search: Allows users to search for weather in any city.

Dynamic UI: Displays weather icons (emojis) and tailored messages (e.g., "It's üç¶ time" for hot weather).

Loading Screen: Shows a spinner while data is being fetched.

Permission Handling: Checks and requests location permissions with user-friendly alerts.

Dark Theme: Uses a dark theme for better visibility.

Background Images: Custom backgrounds for location and city search screens.

Prerequisites
Flutter SDK (version 3.0 or later recommended). Install from flutter.dev.

Dart SDK (comes bundled with Flutter).

An API key from OpenWeatherMap. The code uses a placeholder key (5010291ddd8c8a75cb99bbc15c9d9667)‚Äîreplace it with your own to avoid rate limits.
